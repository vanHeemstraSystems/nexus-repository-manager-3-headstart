# 200 Example Use Case

## Why You Need a Repository Manager

## Use Case
The following use case provides an example that highlights the need for a repository manager in your organization. Use this to get an idea of how Nexus Repository Manager can be utilized on your team.

## Background
You are part of a small team working to apply a DevOps approach to your organization. The development team is primarily JAVA-focused with heavy Maven and Central Repository usage.

## Challenge
Currently, developers are downloading the same components over and over again, slowing down production and decreasing build performance.

## Solution
Develop a proof of concept for a repository manager that helps alleviate slow downloads related to open source component usage. Begin thinking of repository configuration specific to your organization.

## Results
- Centralized management for components means the development team can download all their dependencies from Nexus Repository Manager.
- Improved software build performance due to faster component download off the local repository manager.
- Reduced bandwidth usage due to component caching.
- Higher predictability and scalability due to limited dependency on remote repositories.
- Increased understanding of component usage due to centralized storage of all used components.
- Simplified developer configuration due to central access configuration to remote repositories and components on the repository manager.
- Unified method to provide components to consumers reducing complexity overheads.
- Improved collaboration due to the simplified exchange of binary components.
