# 100 What You'll Do 

## Lab Overview
Welcome to the Repository Planning lab.

The lab is where you can take the information you learned in the three lessons of this course, and put it all together when you start planning your Nexus Repository Manager installation. The lab should take you about thirty minutes, and it goes over the following:

- A course summary of what you’ve learned so far.
- An example use case for why you need a repository manager.
- A repository planning checklist.

If you’ve gone through the three lessons in this module, you have taken in a lot of information. We’ll quickly go over what you’ve learned so far:

- In lesson one you learned that a repository manager is a dedicated server application used to manage all the repositories your development teams interact with. You also learned that repository management is an important part of any organization’s software development life cycle because it manages software components required for development, deployment, and provisioning.
- In lesson two you discovered that formats are archive files that consists of programs and accompanying metadata needed by package managers like npm and YUM, or build tools like Maven. You also learned that a component can be any item like a package, library, binary, or container that is produced or used by your software applications. Finally you learned that components in the repository manager are identified by a specific set of values that varies based on the format.
- In lesson three you learned that Nexus Repository Manager has three defined repository types: Proxy repositories let you connect to remote repositories and cache components, hosted repositories are for housing internal components, and group repositories are used to combine multiple repositories into a single item with one URL for configuration.

All of this information comes together when planning your Nexus Repository Manager implementation. Understanding the formats used in your organization and the components housed in those formats directly influences the repository types you’ll create in the repository manager. Before completing the checklist or worksheet, take a look at the example use case to get an idea of the benefits realized when installing a repository manager.
