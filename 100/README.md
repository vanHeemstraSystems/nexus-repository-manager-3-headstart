# 100 Repository Management Basics

## Objectives
This course is designed to provide new customers with the first steps towards optimizing their Nexus Repository Manager configuration. Specifically, it provides critical, high-level theory, best practice, and practical application related to understanding specific concepts and terminology related to Nexus Repository Manager.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

- The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The SDLC is composed of a number of defined and distinct work phases used by systems engineers and developers to plan, design, build, test, and deliver software. For more information, please see [SDLC – Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview) from Tutorials Point.
- Modern DevOps practices. The basis of DevOps is to unify software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software development, from integration, testing, and releasing to deployment and infrastructure management. For more information, please see [What is DevOps from Sonatype](https://guides.sonatype.com/foundations/devops/what-is-devops/).
- Continuous integration and delivery. Continuous integration is a practice that encourages developers to integrate their code into a main branch of a shared repository early and often. Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration. It focuses on automating the software delivery process so that teams can easily and confidently deploy their code to production at any time. For more information, please see [An Introduction to Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment).
- Source control systems. A version control system designed to track changes in source code and other text files during the development of a piece of software. For more information, please see Git’s [About Version Control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).
