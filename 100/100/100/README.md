## What is a Repository Manager?
To get started, letâ€™s think of a repository manager like you would think of a warehouse for parts. A warehouse serves as a centralized location for storage of parts and manages receiving, sending, and everything in between. Even with Lean business models, there is a need to manage and store parts using a system that is optimized for that purpose. 

The warehouse for software parts is called a repository manager. Repository managers play an essential role in any enterprise, or open-source, software development effort allowing you to manage all parts involved in the development process and avoid inefficient practices. Implementing a repository manager allows you to:

- Enable greater collaboration between developers.
- Bring increased build performance due to a wider distribution of software and locally available parts.
- Reduce network bandwidth and dependency on remote repositories.
- Insulate your company from outages in the internet, outages of public repositories (Maven Central, npm, etc.), or even removal of an open source component.
