# 300 Repo for SDLC Management

## Why Do I Need a Repository Manager?
Most of todayâ€™s software is assembled using open source, proprietary, and third party code. Because of this, many organizations rely on repository management to efficiently source, store, share, and deploy software parts. Rather than direct download from public repositories, repeated downloads, or manual distribution, using a repository manager makes it the central access and management point for any component usage in your software development life cycle. This central role makes it easy for everyone in your organization to understand where things are stored.

Using a repository manager allows you to manage parts required for software development, application deployment, and automated hardware provisioning. It also fulfills a central role for application life cycle management. A repository manager greatly simplifies the maintenance of your own internal repositories and access to remote repositories. In addition, integrating a repository manager into your organization lets you accomplish the following:

- Manage binary software code through the software development life cycle.
- Search and browse software components.
- Control code releases with rules and add automated notifications.
- Integrate with external security systems, such as LDAP or Atlassian Crowd.
- View component metadata.
- Host internal items not available in remote repositories.
- Control access by authenticating and authorizing specific sets or groups of users.

Relying on a repository manager lets you gain new visibility into the quality of items flowing through your software supply chains, helping to avoid downstream technical debt and unplanned work.
