# 400 Security Model

## Course Goals
Learners will successfully streamline the administration and management of access control in NXRM3 by using best practices when creating and managing users, privileges, and roles. This will be accomplished by understanding privileges and their actions when assigned to users and roles, and how those are used to create protected repositories for multiple departments or development groups.

## Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to…

- Identify the default users, roles, and key built-in privileges.
- Create and manage users.
- Create and manage roles.
- Map NXRM roles to external user groups (LDAP in this example).
- Assign privileges and users to roles.

## Prerequisites
This lesson assumes learners are familiar with all of the concepts covered in the NXRM-SEC-100 Security Essentials course .

## Target Audience
The target audience for this course is the Repository Administrator, and anyone who wants to learn more about users, roles, and privileges in the NXRM3 security model.

## Estimated Time to Complete
30 minutes

## System Requirements
Demo version of NXRM3 – Download and install a test environment for the purpose of this lesson if you do not already have one installed.
The product version used in this course may be different than your own. The screens may have a different display, but the content and concepts remain generally the same.

## Setting Expectations
We will discuss in depth how to create and manage users, privileges, and roles in order to manage security and access control of your NXRM3. We will also touch on, but not take a deep dive into:

- Configuring LDAP (realms)
- Architecture options for NXRM3
- Common NXRM architectures

As these are all critical aspects of the NXRM security model, they will be covered in greater detail in separate courses.
